echo "God Mode and Stealth Mode are now implemented as proper IRC user modes:"

echo "üî± GOD MODE (+G):"
echo "  /mode mynick +G     # Enable God Mode - Ultimate channel override powers"
echo "  /mode mynick -G     # Disable God Mode"
echo ""
echo "  Capabilities:"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Join banned/invite-only/password/full channels"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Cannot be kicked by anyone"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Override all channel restrictions"
echo ""

echo "üëª STEALTH MODE (+S):"
echo "  /mode mynick +S     # Enable Stealth Mode - Invisible to regular users"
echo "  /mode mynick -S     # Disable Stealth Mode"
echo ""
echo "  Effects:"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Hidden from /who and /names for regular users"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Still visible to other operators"

echo "‚ö° COMBINED USAGE:"
echo "  /mode mynick +GS    # Enable both modes simultaneously"
echo "  /mode mynick -GS    # Disable both modes"

echo "üìã REQUIREMENTS:"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Must be an IRC operator (/oper)"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Operator class must have 'god_mode' and/or 'stealth_mode' permissions"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Can only set modes on yourself"

echo '  "rank": 4,'
echo '  "permissions": ["*", "god_mode", "stealth_mode"]'

echo "This follows proper IRC conventions - user modes instead of custom commands!"
echo "Use /mode +G and /mode +S just like any other IRC user mode."
