## Requirements

- Go 1.21 or higher

## Building

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Build the server
go run tools/build.go -build

# Or use the traditional method
go build -o techircd
```

## Build Options

The `tools/build.go` script provides several build options:

```bash
# Build and run
go run tools/build.go -run

# Run tests
go run tools/build.go -test

# Format code
go run tools/build.go -fmt

# Cross-platform builds
go run tools/build.go -build-all

# Optimized release build
go run tools/build.go -release

# Clean build artifacts
go run tools/build.go -clean

# Show all options
go run tools/build.go -help
```

## Usage

```bash
./techircd
```

The server will start on localhost:6667 by default. You can configure the host and port in `config.go`.

## Configuration

Edit `config.go` to customize:
- Server host and port
- Server name and description
- Maximum connections
- Ping timeout
- Message of the Day (MOTD)

## Connecting

You can connect using any IRC client:
```
/server localhost 6667
```

Or use the included test client:
```bash
go run test_client.go
```

## Architecture

- `main.go` - Entry point and server initialization
- `server.go` - Main IRC server implementation with concurrent connection handling
- `client.go` - Client connection handling and state management
- `channel.go` - Channel management with thread-safe operations
- `commands.go` - IRC command implementations (NICK, USER, JOIN, PART, etc.)
- `config.go` - Server configuration structure
- `test_client.go` - Simple test client for development
