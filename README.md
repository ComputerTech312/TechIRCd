- Panic recovery and error handling
- Resource monitoring and health checks
- Graceful shutdown capabilities

### üìä **Monitoring & Logging**
- Real-time health monitoring
- Memory usage tracking

- Performance metrics logging
- Configurable log levels and rotation
- Private messaging
- WHO/WHOIS commands
- Configurable server settings

## Requirements

- Go 1.21 or higher

## Building

```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o techircd
```

## Usage

```bash
./techircd
```

The server will start on localhost:6667 by default. You can configure the host and port in `config.go`.

## Configuration

Edit `config.go` to customize:
- Server host and port
- Server name and description
- Maximum connections
- Ping timeout
- Message of the Day (MOTD)

## Connecting

You can connect using any IRC client:
```
/server localhost 6667
```

Or use the included test client:
```bash
go run test_client.go
```

## Architecture

- `main.go` - Entry point and server initialization
- `server.go` - Main IRC server implementation with concurrent connection handling
- `client.go` - Client connection handling and state management
- `channel.go` - Channel management with thread-safe operations
- `commands.go` - IRC command implementations (NICK, USER, JOIN, PART, etc.)
- `config.go` - Server configuration structure
- `test_client.go` - Simple test client for development
